# GOAL: compress/uncompress binary strings using adaptive run-length encoding.

# Builds on a solution for the part of Homework 6, which I refer to 
# as Run Length Encoding (RLE).  If you read carefully and make sure you
# understand each part before going on, you probably won't find this 
# too difficult.  

# Note: we will work with binary strings of characters like '0110', for ease 
# of understanding and testing.  A real-world encoder for a format like 
# zip-files or mp3 files would not use characters!  It would use binary data, 
# where each bit really is one bit, rather than a character code which takes 
# 8 or 16 bits (ASCII or UniCode encoding, respectively).

# The goal is to define functions compressA and uncompressA,
# using run length encoding in an 'adaptive' way.  The possible
# run lengths are based on analysis of the string to be compressed;
# this determines how many bits are used to represent each run length.
# That number must be included in the compressed data, so it can
# be used when un-compressing.

# The compressed format, which I call RLE+, looks like this:
#       bbbwxwxwxwx...
# - bbb is three bits, which represent a number runBits, 0 < runBits < 8
# - each w is a string of runBits bits and encodes the length of a run of 0s
# - each x is a string of runBits bits and encodes the length of a run of 1s
# Note that the wxwxw... part is the same as what is used in Homework 6,
# except in that homework runBits is always 5.

# For example, 010 10 10 01 10  (but without spaces)
#              bbb w  x  w  x
# encodes the string 001101, using runBits=2.

# The compressA function should first scan the input string to determine
# how long is the average run length, avgLen, and then choose a sensible
# number of bits to use for encoding run lengths.  Here is how we will
# choose that number: let runBits be one more than the log of avgLen, 
# but at most 7.  This means we compress using runs of length less 
# than 2**runBits.
# More precisely: 
# let n = math.ceil(math.log(m,2)) + 1 and runBits = min(n,7).

# If runBits is 1, compression is pointless, but we'll do it anyway.

########
# Step 0
# Before working on adaptive RLE, have a look at the code below
# which provides basic RLE.  It's like a solution for Homework 6,
# but the main functions are more general.

# Number of bits for data in the Homework 6 RLE format.
# The hw6 assignment refers to this as k, and I refer to it as runBits.
